# ImageOptimiser
Easy to use image optimiser GUI

Designed to be similar to PNGGauntlet, but with the added ability to <b>lossessly</b> optimise JPEG's using JPEGtran, and possibly in future to convert PNG's to FLIF when specified.
<p>
<b>Currently can do:</b><br>

Multi-threaded <b>lossless</b> image optimising (Currently only JPEGs)<br>
Allows drag and drop of images, or folders containing images onto the list<br>
Allows changing the optimiser settings in the options dialog<br>
Set process priority of optimisers<br></p>
<br>
<p>
<b>Plans</b><br>
Add PNG optimiser (Same as included in PNGGauntlet)<br>
Add PNG > FLIF<br>
Add the ability to use -scans in JPEGtran to provide further JPEG optimisation at the cost of speed (not sure how to use this switch yet)<br>
